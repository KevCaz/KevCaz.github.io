## About me

I'm **Kevin Cazelles** and for over seven years now, I have been tackling
research challenges in various areas of ecology. I have mainly been focusing on
theory in macro-ecology and network ecology (check out my [PhD
dissertation <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" aria-hidden="true"></i>](/docs/thesekc.pdf)) but I have also been working on various
topics such as epidemics, forest dynamics, homogenization of fish communities,
analysis of media coverage, meta-ecosystems and food security. I have been
facing a wide spectrum of technical problems and have acquired a very broad set
of quantitative skills including wavelets analysis, biodiversity analysis,
network analysis, Bayesian statistics, etc.

 <!-- I am currently doing quantitative ecology for a
leaving. As such, I do my best to apply the results of abstract investigations
to tangible challenges such as the impact of global change on ecological
communities. -->
