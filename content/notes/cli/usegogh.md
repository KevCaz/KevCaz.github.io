As mentioned in a [previous note](/notes/cli/paste2gnuterm), I now use Atom together with Gnome Terminal for most of my coding and writing time and really enjoy my current setup. As I use two different applications, I have similar but slightly different color schemes, which, weirdly enough, has been bugging me for a while... That is why, a few days ago, I started to edit the color but looking a the them repository of the Atom theme I liked (e.g. [Atom Material](https://github.com/atom-material)) when I came to realize that someone should have already found a simple way to install several geeky themes. Turns out I was correct (not the hardest guess admittedly), the name of this project is [Gogh](http://mayccoll.github.io/Gogh/) (I dare assume it is a reference to Vincent van Gogh) and it is awesome :smiley:!!

Once Gnome Terminal opened, use (as explained on the website):

```sh
$  bash -c  "$(wget -qO- https://git.io/vQgMr)"
```

and then chose the color schemes to be installed. Once installed, use the right click to select the profile you want (go to `Edit` => `Preferences` on the menu bar to change the defauyt profile) as shown in the video available on the [main page of the GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh). Gogh => :clap: :trophy: :sparkles: :fireworks:
