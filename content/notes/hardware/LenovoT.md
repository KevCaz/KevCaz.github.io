When I switched from MacOS to Debian, I had no idea what laptop to buy
so I searched for some information on the Internet. As expected it was hard
to find reliable sources of information among websites that are obviously not
neutral. After a few hours on the net, I ended up buying a [Lenovo ThinkPad T470p](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470p-Core-i7-GeForce-940MX-Laptop-Review.226802.0.html)
and [installed Debian on](https://insileco.github.io/2018/01/21/setting-my-debian-stretch-up/),
so far so good, very happy I made this choice.

Now that I am on several Debian mailing lists, it actually seems that Debian
users generally appreciate Lenovo as a brand and more particularly the
[ThinkPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad) line of laptop. I retain
some advice from the mails Debian users are exchanging:

1. if you can afford it, always consider buying a laptop from a professional line
of product as they generally come with better hardware and a better warranty,

2. if you are handy and conformable with tinkering your computer, then chose
a computer that you can actually fix by your-self! For instance, avoid RAM
soldered into the motherboard,

3. thinner is not always better, in most cases, the thinner the less likely
to meet point 2! I read something quite funny about few days ago: while the
weight of laptop has dramatically decreased over the past decade, the same
remark does not apply to the laptop chargers, we therefore are going towards a
situation where the laptop weight equals the charger weight :imp:, better to
buy a tablet computer.
