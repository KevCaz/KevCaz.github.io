Given that I spend most of my working time on a code editor (including to write
papers), I regard the choice of the font as quite important. To me, a programming
font must be [monospaced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font)
(programming without a monospaced font is quite challenging) and appeal to me
(a matter of readability and aesthetic I guess).

There are tons of fonts nowadays and it is quite easy to create your own (see for instance
[fontstruc](https://fontstruct.com/)), so the choice is wide! Some people
that propose selection of programming fonts, for instance on [hivelogic.com](http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts/),
very helpful.


Currently, I am using mainly two sets of fonts: [the ones by powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
and the [FiraCode fonts](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
I set up [Atom](https://atom.io/) and my Terminals with *Ubuntu Mono derivative Powerline*
and *Roboto Mono for Powerline* and I am experimenting [FiraCode fonts
in RStudio](
https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/RStudio-instructions) (see below). I was not aware
of [programming ligature](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/MonospacedProgrammingFontsWithLigatures.aspx) before using FiraCode, it's really neat.
