Yesterday I learned **3** more [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) symbols while I was reviewing a paper :smiley_cat::

- an equivalence symbol: `$\equiv$` $\equiv$,
- use `\xi` not `$\ksi$` for $\xi$,
- `$\widehat{}$` for estimators (in statistics), for instance: $\widehat{\xi}$.

Also, it was a good opportunity to remind myself that when looking for a specific symbol, one can always google an approximate description of the it, **or** one can use [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) an extremely helpful LaTeX handwritten symbol recognition system!
