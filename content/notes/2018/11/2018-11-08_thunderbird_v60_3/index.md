As I mentioned in [a previous note](/notes/mozilla/olderthuderbirdversion/), when
I installed the version 60.0-3 of Thunderbird I was no longer able to write new
emails and so I had to downgrade to v.52.9.1. Since that time, things have gotten
worst as I was no longer able to get hyperlinks opening the corresponding page
in my web browser :scream:. I did not look for a fix, I simply coped with it waiting
for an update. Yesterday, at last, I installed 60.3.0 and it solves all my issues,
everything is back to normal :fireworks:!

```sh
$ thunderbird --version
Thunderbird 60.3.0

$ firefox --version
Mozilla Firefox 60.3.0
```
