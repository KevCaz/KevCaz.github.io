A very short note to mention that yesterday  [Steve
Vissault](https://steveviss.github.io/) and I published [a post on rOpenSci
about rmangal :link:]( https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/10/21/rmangal/). In a
nutshell rmangal is a R client for the [Mangal](https://mangal.io/#/) data base
that includes > 1300 ecological networks. Check out [the cool poster Steve
created](https://kevcaz.github.io/talks/posters/MANGAL_2019.pdf).
