I have been using the command line for more than 10 years now, I started on MacOS[^termac] and I increased my usage of the Terminal when I switched to Linux. 
I am now comfortable with the Linux command line but still looking for ways to improve my skills. 
Recently, I stumbled into [no starch press](https://nostarch.com/) that offers a great selection of books and found out that several are available at the library. 
That's how I booked [The Linux command line](https://nostarch.com/tlcl2) by William Shotts. 

The book does a fantastic jobs explaining why and how to work with Linux command line. 
William Shotts gives to the reader just the right level of details to understand how the shell works and why it is so powerful. 
The first part "Learning the shell" introduces the most important commands. 
Here I am listing 1. a few topics that I am very glad I read more about and 2. the list of commands introduced in the book. 
I strongly recommend the reading of this book and if for any reason you cannot buy it or book it, note that the author maintains a website 
(https://linuxcommand.org/index.php) that includes most of the material covered in the book (with less details). 

Below is a list of five topics that reading about have already been beneficial.
Note that this list is personal, all the 10 first chapters cover important topics and the way material is presented is very didactic. 

- reading the [`ls -l` output](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0030.php);
- the logic and the power of [i/o redirection](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0070.php), e.g importance of standard input;
- [expansions](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0080.php);
- softlinks and hardlinks;
- [permission](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0090.php) (including the sticky bit).

The following table includes commands that are introduced in the first part (except `du` and `shuf` that I added my-self). 
Note that there are `bash` commands and if you use a different shell (e.g. `zsh`) some commands may be missing (there are likely equivalent commands available). 
Options presented in the table are the ones that are either presented in the book, or options that I think are the most important ones (meaning the one you are ore likely to use). 
The command 'Usage' indicates how frequently I use a given command: one star means daily, 2 means weekly and 3 means every now and then.
Last, `Category` is my attempt to categorize the commands, in the book commands are introduced in different chapters, which makes it clear in what context you are expected to use them.



[^termac]: Back then, I jotted down some notes about my usage of the terminal https://github.com/inSileco/AvecLeTerminal/tree/master.
