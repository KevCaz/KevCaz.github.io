Recently, I formatted an external hard drive and I created several partitions on it. For doing so, I used to very good tools:

1. [Disks](https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/Apps/Disks) (gnome-disks)
2. [GParted](https://gparted.org/) (GNOME Partition Editor)

Both tools are intuitive and makes your live really easy. You can also find good tutorials on line (e.g. looks at [this answer on <i class="fa fa-stack-exchange" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://askubuntu.com/questions/315914/step-by-step-guide-to-partition-an-external-hdd-in-two-file-formats) for a step by step GParted tutorial). I've just realized that GParted is actually the GUI for [GNU Parted](https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/parted.html) that will try next time I want to partition an hard drive (I've spotted this [tuto](https://www.tecmint.com/parted-command-to-create-resize-rescue-linux-disk-partitions/) :smile:).
