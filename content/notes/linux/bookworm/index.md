  This post explains how I switch from Debian 11 to Debian 12.

Two weeks ago, [Bullseye](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBullseye) became the new stable Debian release. As I prefer using Debian testing, today, I jumped on Debian 12 codenamed [**Bookworm**](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBookworm). To do so, I simply updated my [source list](https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList) by replacing instances of `bullseye` by `bookworm`, and then I used the combo 
`apt update`/ `apt upgrade`. 

```sh
$ apt-get update
[...] 
$ apt-get upgrade

The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
  gir1.2-handy-0.0 gnome-getting-started-docs libgcrypt20-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libjuh-java libjurt-java
  liblibreoffice-java libridl-java libunoloader-java
Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove them.
The following packages have been kept back:
  cryptsetup cryptsetup-bin cryptsetup-initramfs gnome-software  [...]
  udisks2 vlc-plugin-video-output
The following packages will be upgraded:

Need to get 841 MB of archives.
After this operation, 43.4 MB of additional disk space will be used.

```

It took a few minutes, then I dealt with the "kept back" packages with the following:

```sh
$ apt-get --with-new-pkgs upgrade 
```

That is it for updating Debian! 

```sh
$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Debian
Description:	Debian GNU/Linux bookworm/sid
Release:	testing
Codename:	bookworm
```

Note that I could easily use `testing` in the source list rather than the codename of the Debian release, but I actually like the codename better, it's not much of an effort and it forces me to keep an eye on what's going on! 

{{< figcenter "bookworm.webp" 50 "**Bookworm**. Debian releases are codenamed after Toy Story characters. Debian 12 has been codenamed Bookworm, a reference to a character that appears in Toy Story 3. This picture is available at the following https://pixar.fandom.com/wiki/Bookworm. " >}}


I did not stop there, I took two extra steps. First, I installed R 4.1.1, following the guidelines available at https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian/#debian-sid-unstable. Note that reinstall some of the package because of this (quoting from the webpage I've just mentioned): 


> Note that R 4.1.x has bumped the Graphics API, so graphics packages like svglite, tikzDevice, rgl, rvg, ggplot2 or vdiffr (embedding svglite) will need to be reinstalled. If you donâ€™t you will get an error message


Just to be sure (not 100% if it was needed), I re-installed the following packages (and meta-packages):


```R
R> install.packages(c("sf", "stars", "mapview" "tidyverse", "fastverse")) 
```


Second (and last), I reinstall Docker following the walkthrough available at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/ and made sure the installation was correct using the following:

```sh
$ sudo docker run hello-world 
```

So all is working great! For the sake of completeness, below in my current source list `/etc/apt/sources.list` (I have a few others in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` but they don't matter for this post!):
