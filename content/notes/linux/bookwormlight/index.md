  In this post I shared my latest Debian setup.
---

I recently decided to re-install my computer and I took the opportunity to
create a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) that includes light version of my
Debian 11 set-up, i.e. all the tools I used the most. Once again during the
install (I use a [Debian weekly build installation
image](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/)) did not keep things
light as I let several pieces of software be installed during the setup (e.g.
LibreOffice, Inkscape). So here goes the 4th version of my bash script to
install Debian on my Lenovo T470p :arrow_down:. It works well, as always!
