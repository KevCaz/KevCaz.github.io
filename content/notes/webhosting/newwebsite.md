## Context

Almost a year ago now, I worked on a new version of my webiste, this website (on 2020).  I
must say that I am very happy with this new version and I decided that for the
100th post of this series I would report what I have done and provide a few
tips. below I explained a bti what I have done and how. All code ois available on lines and will give the right links. 

As far as I remembered, I have worked with 5 different versions of my personal
website. The first one was a home made from scratch using CSS, HTML and a bit of PHP. Even though I worked on it in 2012, it looked like a website from
the 90's...  Then in 2014 (not a 100% about that) I rebuilt my website using Jekyll (this version is now
achieved on [GitHub](https://github.com/KevCaz/KevCazWebsite)) I kind of like
it but the liquid part, I did not carfully foollowed what is done with Jelyy
these days so I won't go any futher bit on GH useful to quiclky create a pahe. 

Then I dealt witrh three different Hugo version. For the first version
I used the [academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) then
[Hugo Xmin](https://xmin.yihui.org/) I tweaked a built
https://github.com/KevCaz/hugo-KevCaz And now I really wrote a theme from sracth.
I use more and more and though time was ripe to do really my own
Must say alaos insilico was another ewxpericnece with Hugo and I built/help builbing three other websites with this tecnhiclo since. Frankly speaking it is amazing (I tried quiclky using WISIG such as Wordpress and Wix Mix,,, not really mu cuo of tea). 

I had a set of goals to achieve when I rebuilt from..
Basically design: 1 left side bar, I was tired of the header and a secon
with the (basically what you see here )
and of course responsive. 

Main goal was to create my own theme and this 

Truth be told I don't need much, I just needed to have and I like having control
of all aspect and I am now relatively conforntable with hugo wich I find pretty
neat. But also realise how much useful to share keep stuf in mind. It is one of
the most useful working tool. A bit like the nav you have on Hugo
https://gohugo.io/news/0.60.0-relnotes/

- very light
- using sass (did not use it before)
- do
- avoid loading hevy library for my simple meed and do y own javascript.

I also took time to look at what was new in Hugo >0.60. Turns out there is
many good features that I simply embraced.
- using as much Hugo future as I meed, and always use hugo featureas as I needed
and always chose a built in feature over an additional libray (I'll come back a bit more about this)


Below I detail a bit more about all of this (especially to list useful resource)
