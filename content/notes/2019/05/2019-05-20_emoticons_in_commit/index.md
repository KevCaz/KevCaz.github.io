I recently wrote a [note about using emoticons in a standard way in commit
messages](/notes/git/commitmessages/) and I now use them in a standard way following [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/). I do so for my code, but I also use [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for manuscrits and I also try to standardize the way I use emoticons in that case. Below is the set of emoticons I am currently using for manuscrits:

- :pencil: `pencil` add a significant piece of writing, paragraph;
- :pencil2: `pencil2`typos;
- :bar_chart: `bar_chart` figures added or edited (figure or its caption);
- :wastebasket: `wastebasket` delete an file;
- :sparkles: `sparkles` integrate co-author's comment(s)/work;
- :tada: `tada` address reviewer's comment(s);
- :arrow_up: `arrow_up` version submitted;
- :rocket: `rocket` version accepted.
