For 3 years now, I have been maintaining a small R :package: named
[inSilecoMisc](https://github.com/inSileco/inSilecoMisc) that includes a set of
of handy functions. As time goes, my skills evolves (hopefully in a good direction) and so does the content of these packages: I had function that suit my new needs, I realize that some functions I wrote are (better) coded elsewhere, I rewrite functions to make then more intuitive and I improve the documentation.

Today, I took some time to do a good cleanup of the package and release [version v0.2.0](https://github.com/inSileco/inSilecoMisc/releases/tag/v0.2.0). Although there is still room for improvement, this version I quite clean :smile:! If you are wondering about the features included in the package have a look at [the overview vignette](http://insileco.github.io/inSilecoMisc/articles/overview.html) :pencil:.
