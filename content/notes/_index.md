In my professional life, I spend a fair amount of my time on my computer
looking at new freeware, new computational tools, new programming languages, etc.
to find better practices and share them with colleagues. That is the
reason why I partnered up with colleagues/friends to start
[inSileco](https://blog.insileco.io/), a blog that focuses on computational
tools for ecologists. I try to post on this blog regularly medium-size articles
and I decided to report short notes here. Note that I am currently [working
on Debian](https://blog.insileco.io/2018/06/18/my-r-setup-on-debian/) (see below for my current configuration),
and hence the content of the notes below may sometimes be valid only the
distribution I am using (*e.g.* keyboard shortcuts). Finally, the complete list
of tags used throughout these notes is available [here](/tags/).
