I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) not only for coding but also for manuscripts editing.
It actually makes a ton of sense to me as I write my manuscripts in Markdown and
Atom is provided with many powerful features (specific packages, shortcuts, etc.) that once combined make my writing very efficient (I like to think so). Recently, Timothée Poisot shared a very cool setup:

I also enjoy [autocomplete-bibtex](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-bibtex)
and [document-outline](https://atom.io/packages/document-outline) but I often
get quite distracted by the [preview](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced)
and prefer working with a very minimalist environment, which is why I like [the zen package](https://atom.io/packages/Zen) so much!
