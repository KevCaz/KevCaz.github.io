As a quantitative ecologist, I tackle research challenges in various
areas of ecology. I mainly focused on theory in macro-ecology and
network ecology (check out my [PhD dissertation <i class="fas fa-file-pdf"
aria-hidden="true"></i>](/docs/thesekc.pdf)) but I also worked on
various topics such as epidemics, forest dynamics, homogenization of fish
communities, analysis of media coverage, meta-ecosystems and food security. I
faced a wide spectrum of technical problems and have acquired a very
broad set of quantitative skills including wavelets analysis, biodiversity
analysis, network analysis, Bayesian statistics, etc.
