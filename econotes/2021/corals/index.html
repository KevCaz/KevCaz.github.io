The process of forming a new clone is called budding (or fragmentation). Corals also reproduce sexually and this is how new colonies are created. Just as the other cnidarians, corals have cnidocytes that are cells that produce <a href=https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnida>cnidae</a> (or cnidocysts) which are large and complex organelles<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> that allow polyps to catch/kill their prey (zooplankton).</p><center><figure><img class=mg-bot src=polyp.png width=80%><figcaption><div class="highlight justify"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden></i> Gross anatomy of a scleractinian polyp from an imperforate coral (from Galloway et al., 2007).</div></figcaption></figure></center><p>Currently, corals are classified into two main branches<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>:</p><ol><li><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleractinia>Scleractinia</a>, an order that includes hard corals (or stony corals)</p></li><li><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcyonacea>Alcyonacea</a>, which includes soft coral and gorgonian corals.</p></li></ol><p>Note that according to the figure below, which summarizes the current the phylogenetic classification of corals, the term &ldquo;corals&rdquo; does not represent a monophyletic group<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>.</p><center><figure><img class=mg-bot src=phylo.png width=70%><figcaption><div class="highlight justify"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden></i> Phylogenetic tree showing the position of Cnidaria (from Palmer & Traylor-Knowles, 2018).</div></figcaption></figure></center><p>In what follows, I am focusing on hard corals (Scleractinia) that I will sometimes refer to as corals. Corals are reef-building corals, as they grow (via budding), they produce an exoskeleton made of <a href=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragonite>aragonite</a> (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). Skeletal structures and micro-structures vary strongly among hard corals and have long been the primary determinant of coral taxonomy<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>. To grow, corals have to feed. As mentioned above, hard corals feed on zooplankton<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup> and they are also able to adsorb dissolved organic matter. But the main source of carbon is provided by their endosymbionts, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooxanthellae>zooxanthellae</a> (dinoflagelates) of the genus Symbiodinium (see figure above). Zooxanthellae are single-celled photosythetic organism of ~10 μm. On top of providing carbon as carbohydrates and lipids to their host, zooxanthellae color corals: while coral tissues are rather transparent, zooxanthella chloroplasts have colorful pigments (e.g. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peridinin>peridin</a>) that are associated with chlorophyll and contribute to the photosynthesis. Hence reef-building corals are mixotroph, and it has recently been shown by Fox et al. (2018)<sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup> that corals were capable of adapting their strategy to the environment: in more productive environments, corals feed more on zooplankton.</p><center><figure><img class=mg-bot src=detail_polyp.png width=100%><figcaption><div class="highlight justify"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden></i> (A) Close up of coral polyps (Image credit: Alison Moulding / National Coral Reef Institute).

The most severe threat to coral reef (and presumably the most famous one) is bleaching. As explained in Rosenberg et al. (2013)<sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup>:</p><blockquote><p>Coral bleaching is the disruption of the symbiosis between the coral host and its endosymbiotic algae.</p></blockquote><p>Following the disruption, i.e. the loss of their endosymbionts and the pigments they contain, corals lose their colors, and as the aragonite of their exoskeleton is white, they appear white (which explains the term &ldquo;bleaching&rdquo;). Coral bleaching could be seen as a disease, a disease that has many causes. Recent massive and pervasive bleaching events<sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup> have been linked with sustained water temperature rises which cause irreversible damage to the endosymbionts leading to the disruption of the symbiosis. Corals do not necessarily die following the bleaching event, there is a short period of time that allows for a recovery, i.e. for the restoration of the symbiosis. Once passed this period, the colony dies<sup id=fnref:11><a href=#fn:11 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>11</a></sup>.</p><center><figure><img class=mg-bot src=bleaching.png width=100%><figcaption><div class="highlight justify"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden></i> Coral bleaching distribution.

It has recently been shown experimentally than an imbalanced in the ratio Nitrogen/Phosphorus lowers the thermal tolerance of corals to bleaching<sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup>. Hence, anthropogenic eutrophication promotes bleaching events and a recent study in Florida synthesizing 3 decades of observations is very consistent with these findings<sup id=fnref:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup>. It has also been shown that certain micro-organisms that infect corals can induce coral bleaching<sup id=fnref1:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup>.</p><p>Bleaching is a major threat to corals and it has major impact on large and species rich ecosystems. Ecological dynamics are being destabilized and this might lead to even more negative impacts on coral reefs. In the new project I am working on, we are focusing on the ecological interactions in coral reefs and I will expand on this in the next section. The important point here being that coral reefs are in severe danger and as cogently stated by Mumby & Steneck (2008)<sup id=fnref:14><a href=#fn:14 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>14</a></sup>:</p><blockquote><p>The paradigm of widespread healthy, stable coral reef ecosystems has evolved to one that views them as patchy, unstable and fragile.</p></blockquote><h2 id=corals-algal-turf-macroalgae-and-parrot-fishes>Corals, algal turf, macroalgae and parrot fishes</h2><p>By building reefs, corals actually create complex habitats that hundreds of fish species inhabit. When corals die, erosion alter the hard skeletons they have left. This can be a slow and steady process, but extreme events, such as storms, can tear off large chunks of aragonite instantly. A major consequence of the death of corals is the loss of structural complexity, which is often quantified by rugosity. As explained in Alvarez-Filip et al. (2009)<sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup></p><blockquote><p>The rugosity index is expressed as the ratio between the total length of a chain and the length of the same chain when moulded to a reef surface.</p></blockquote><p>It has been demonstrated in the Caribbeans that rugosity has drastically decreased since the 70&rsquo;s. The figure below shows that the decline of rugosity in the Caribbean was actually 3 phases process: 1- loss due to a disease that affect most of the reefs, 2- stable phase (less erosion), 3- decline likely due to bleaching events<sup id=fnref1:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup>.</p><center><figure><img class=mg-bot src=rugosity.png width=70%><figcaption><div class="highlight justify"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden></i> Changes in reef rugosity on reefs across the Caribbean from 1969 to 2008.

Healthy and complex reefs offer a wide array of habitats that suit hundreds of fish species at various (when not all) stages of their life cycle. It has been demonstrated that the higher the structural complexity, the higher the fish biodiversity<sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup> making the loss of structural complexity quite problematic for human populations that depend on fishing.</p><center><figure><img class=mg-bot src=richness_complexity.png width=80%><figcaption><div class="highlight justify"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden></i> Relationship between fish species richness and complexity (1: low, 5: high; visually assessed) in protected areas in Bonaire and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) and in a heavily fished area in Puerto Rico, in the Caribbean.</div></figcaption></figure></center><p>What makes this even more interesting (and even more problematic) is that fish also contribute to the maintenance of coral-reefs, at least in the Caribbean<sup id=fnref:17><a href=#fn:17 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>17</a></sup>. To understand how, we need to have a look at the bigger picture. The dynamic of corals-reefs in the Caribbeans have been successfully modeled using 3 types of cover<sup id=fnref:18><a href=#fn:18 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>18</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id=fnref:19><a href=#fn:19 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>19</a></sup>:</p><ol><li><strong>reef-building corals</strong>;</li><li><strong>algal turf</strong>: a group that includes various short algae, including the crustose coralline alga (CCA) that red algae that play important important structural and biotic roles in the reef<sup id=fnref:20><a href=#fn:20 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>20</a></sup>;</li><li><strong>macroalgae</strong>: that are important sources of food for several grazers species.</li></ol><center><figure><img class=mg-bot src=components.png width=80%><figcaption><div class="highlight justify"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden></i> Processes included in the simulation model (arrows) that link the major functional categories of reef organisms (boxes).

Figure and caption from Mumby (2006).</div></figcaption></figure></center><p>On every reef, there is a dynamical equilibrium between these 3 groups that are competing for space. This equilibrium implies various abiotic and biotic components<sup id=fnref1:19><a href=#fn:19 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>19</a></sup> (see figure above). For instance, storms may uproot macroalgae and tear off coral colonies and thereby promote the spread of turf that is less impacted by such events. Parrot fish, as they graze on turfs and macroalgae (this varies among genus, e.g. species of the genus <em>Scarus</em> mainly graze on algal turfs whereas species of the <em>Sparisoma</em> genus have a more varied diet<sup id=fnref:21><a href=#fn:21 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>21</a></sup>) promote the growth of corals. This has actually been tested and validated experimentally<sup id=fnref:22><a href=#fn:22 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>22</a></sup> and fossil records support this mechanism<sup id=fnref:23><a href=#fn:23 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>23</a></sup>.</p><p>Even more interesting, this dynamic presents a strong <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_stable_state#Hysteresis_effects>hysteresis effect</a><sup id=fnref1:18><a href=#fn:18 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>18</a></sup>. In this case, it has been demonstrated that starting from a state where coral cover is relatively high, decreasing the grazing intensity lead to an alternative state where coral cover is low (see figure below). The hysteresis effect is that in order to return to the state where coral cover is high, the grazing intensity has to be significantly greater than what it was when the state changed from higher coral cover to low coral cover. Hence, in the simple situation where fishing pressure was the sole responsible for the change in coral cover, then it would mean that in order to restore the coral cover to what it was previously, the fishing pressure would have to be reduce strongly, presumably to what it was decades ago. Obviously, this is not as simple as reducing fishing pressure, several other factors affect the dynamics, making the problem of protecting corals even harder. For instance, on top of its role in bleaching events, nutrient enrichment can favor overgrowth of algal turfs<sup id=fnref:24><a href=#fn:24 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>24</a></sup>.</p><center><figure><img class=mg-bot src=hysteresis.png width=70%><figcaption><div class="highlight justify"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden></i> Stable and unstable equilibria for Caribbean coral reefs at two levels of algal-coral overgrowth.

Abiotic, biotic and human factors can play various roles and favor any of the three compartments. The resulting changes in cover will continue to have drastic impacts on the biodiversity in the Caribbeans, which ultimately alters the ecosystem services the reefs provide. I hope to be able to help understanding what are the most important threats and what mechanisms should be primary targets for management actions. Mitigating the impacts of human activities without such information would be inefficient (at least), but efficiency is mandatory to successfully protect what is left of Caribbeans coral reefs.</p><center><figure><img class=mg-bot src=feedback.png width=90%><figcaption><div class="highlight justify"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden></i> Schematic representation showing positive and negative feedback processes driving a reef toward either an unhealthy system lacking coral and structural complexity or a healthy system dominated by corals with great structural complexity.
