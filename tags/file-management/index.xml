For years my notes have been organized into a set of folders that serve as categories that I thought were relevant. After 5 years and &amp;gt;120 notes, I realized that the categories were somewhat contrived (e.g. cli, linux), and that it was hard to locate a post and the assets were now managed consistently.</description></item></channel></rss>
