To me, a programming font must be monospaced (programming without a monospaced font is quite challenging) and appeal to me (a matter of readability and aesthetic I guess).
There are tons of fonts nowadays and it is quite easy to create your own (see for instance fontstruc), so the choice is wide!</description></item></channel></rss>
