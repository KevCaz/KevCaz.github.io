Both packages are R clients for web APIs:
rmangal allows users to search ecological interactions available in the Mangal database; rcites allows users to query the Species+ database by leveraging the Speciesplus/CITES Checklist API. One of the main challenges with such packages is to not get archived on CRAN ðŸ˜±! rmangal was actually archived a year ago for policy violation on internet access, and so one of my main goals was to get it back on CRAN.</description></item></channel></rss>
