Both packages are R clients for web APIs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>rmangal&lt;/code> allows users to search ecological interactions available in the &lt;a href="https://mangal.io/#/">Mangal&lt;/a> database;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>rcites&lt;/code> allows users to query the Species+ database by leveraging the &lt;a href="https://api.speciesplus.net/documentation/v1.html">Speciesplus/CITES Checklist API&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One of the main challenges with such packages is to not get archived on CRAN &amp;#x1f631;! &lt;code>rmangal&lt;/code> was actually archived a year ago for policy violation on internet access, and so one of my main goals was to get it back on CRAN. I was relatively aware of ways to avoid using the Internet on CRAN as I had already used &lt;a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vcr">&lt;code>vcr&lt;/code>&lt;/a> for a small project, but I clearly needed to learn more to use it efficiently. Fortunately, &lt;a href="https://masalmon.eu/">Maëlle Salmon&lt;/a> had been working on a very useful book on the topic, &lt;a href="https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/">&lt;em>HTTP testing in R&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, that has a lot of valuable advice that helped me design my tests with &lt;a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vcr">&lt;code>vcr&lt;/code>&lt;/a>!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
