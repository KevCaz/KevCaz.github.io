In my opinion, the two main/direct benefits from having an ORCID account are:
a web page with details about researcher background and publication (see mine at https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6619-9874 and check out this previous note on the topic);
an ORCID account can be used to log in the web interfaces of various scientific journals so that research have a centralized login and personal details for various journals (see the log in page of Global Ecology and Biogeography as an example ⬇️).</description></item><item><title>Get a list of your publications with ORCID</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/biblio/orcidexportref/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/biblio/orcidexportref/</guid><description>ORCID provides you with an unique research identifier that can be used as a login on journals&amp;rsquo; website, a identifier for your papers, R packages (see below), and more).
Your identifier is actually associated with a webpage (see mine: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6619-9874) where you can edit your profile, get a QR code, etc.
It is very easy to search and &amp;ldquo;add works&amp;rdquo; to your account.
Moreover, if the journal you have published with allows you to add your ORCID, your profile will be automatically updated.</description></item></channel></rss>
