The short story behind my website As far as I remembered, I have built 5 different versions of my personal website. I decided to get a website when I was doing my PhD, back in 2014 (not a 100% about sure about the timeline), in order to share some of my work.</description></item><item><title>Deploy a pkgdown website on gh-pages manually</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/ci/deploypkgdown2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/ci/deploypkgdown2/</guid><description>This is another note about deploying a pkgdown1 website with Travis on gh-pages. I had previously used the package travis but I was recently interested in doing so manually. Fortunately, I found this very helpful walk-through by Gábor Csárdi2. I used it and it worked well for a while, but at some point I had an issue with the deployment part (still not sure why), so I changed it. Instead of using the following config3</description></item><item><title>Generate a ssh key with R</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/security/keygen_withr/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/security/keygen_withr/</guid><description>I now frequently use GitHub actions to deploy websites on gh-pages. One way to do so requires to use a ssh key (the full procedure is well explained, inter alia, in the README of peaceiris/actions-gh-pages). As I am used to work with the Terminal, when I need such a key, I use the following command line:
1 $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &amp;#34;$(git config user.email)&amp;#34; -f gh-pages -N &amp;#34;&amp;#34; which generates two files:</description></item><item><title>GitHub pages &amp; custom domain name?

Since I set up the custom domain, I was experiencing a weird issue: after every single deployment even on GitHub Pages (originally done by Travis, now by using a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow) the custom domain was removed and I had to rewrite it every time (see ⬇️) which was pretty annoying.</description></item><item><title>Deploy a pkgdown on gh-pages</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/ci/deploypkgdown/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/ci/deploypkgdown/</guid><description>There are three ways to deploy a website on your GitHub pages :
using the gh-pages; using the folder docs on your master branch; using the master branch. I frequently use the GitHub pages to deploy the pkgdown websites I create for my R packages. For a while, I was using the docs/ folder where the website is generated by default. But I figured that this way has two main drawbacks:</description></item></channel></rss>
