This was mainly a maintenance release following up on a recent issue in vcr (see Overview of fixes for upcoming v1.2) but I also took the opportunity to improve the set_token() function. Now the user has up to five attempts to set up the token when set_token() is called, after that error is triggered (previously the error was triggered after the first failed attempt).</description></item><item><title>rmangal 2.1.2</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2023/01/2023-01-31_rmangal_2_1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2023/01/2023-01-31_rmangal_2_1/</guid><description>A new release of rmangal is now available on CRAN. Following up on a recent issue in vcr (see ' Overview of fixes for upcoming v1.2&amp;rsquo; for more details), I decided to have fixtures written in JSON rather than in YAML, the change was pretty straightforward

Both packages are R clients for web APIs:
rmangal allows users to search ecological interactions available in the Mangal database; rcites allows users to query the Species+ database by leveraging the Speciesplus/CITES Checklist API. One of the main challenges with such packages is to not get archived on CRAN &amp;#x1f631;! rmangal was actually archived a year ago for policy violation on internet access, and so one of my main goals was to get it back on CRAN.</description></item><item><title>Something wrong with rgeos 0.4-1?</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/11/2018-11-07_something_wrong_with/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/11/2018-11-07_something_wrong_with/</guid><description>The last update of rgeos (version 0.4-1) was released on October 19th, 2018 and with my current R set up:
