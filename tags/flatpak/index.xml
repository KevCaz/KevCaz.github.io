It turned out that the developers actually suggest to install their app with either Snap or Flatpak. As I knew about the former and hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard about the later, I decided to install flatpak.
1 $ apt install flatpak I then used flatpak to install Fractal.</description></item></channel></rss>
