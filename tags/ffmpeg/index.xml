For numerous movies and TV shows, it is relatively easy to find subtitles files online (mainly as &lt;code>.srt&lt;/code> files, i.e. &lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/subrip/files/subrip/SubRip%201.57.1/">SubRip files&lt;/a>), but that is not true for all contents!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I thought about automating the generation of subtitles for a minute, I was convinced that with a tool to extract the audio from a movie file and a trained AI model that would generate the transcript, it should be doable to automate the process. My second thought was: &amp;ldquo;If I can envision it so clearly, somebody has done it!&amp;rdquo;. Well&amp;hellip; I was right!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Concatenate audio files with FFmpeg</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2020/10/2020-10-24_concatenate_audio_files/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2020/10/2020-10-24_concatenate_audio_files/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday I needed to combine several audio files and I figured out to do this
with command lines. It was not as easy as I expected but I guess I
underestimated how little I know about audio files! Anyway, below I explain what
I did!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="preparing-my-audio-files">Preparing my audio files&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I had several audio files that I recorded with the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.voicenote&amp;amp;hl=fr_CA&amp;amp;gl=US">voice
recorder&lt;/a>
available on my phone. This application saves audio files as
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14">&lt;code>.m4a&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, so basically I had a
bunch of &lt;code>.m4a&lt;/code> files!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use FFmpeg!</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-13_use_ffmpeg/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-13_use_ffmpeg/</guid><description>&lt;p>As mentioned on its website, &lt;a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg&lt;/a> is:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>FFmep is a powerful freeware, as mentioned on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg">Wikipedia page&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>FFmpeg includes libavcodec, an audio/video codec library used by many commercial and free software products, libavformat (Lavf),[6] an audio/video container mux and demux library, and the core ffmpeg command line program for transcoding multimedia files.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLC_media_player">libavcodec is actually used in VLC&lt;/a>
a popular multimedia you may be familiar with. Personally I value FFmpeg for its
CLI that allows many audio/video format manipulation and conversion. For instance,
in order to get a sample of 3.4 seconds from a video (let&amp;rsquo;s say in &lt;code>.mp4&lt;/code>)
starting at &lt;em>56min42sec500ms&lt;/em> , do this:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
