I have already spent some reading reading &lt;a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/">Julia&amp;rsquo;s documentation&lt;/a> which is great and definitively worth reading, but I was looking for something shorter and found &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href="https://syl1.gitbook.io/julia-language-a-concise-tutorial/">Julia language: a concise tutorial&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/sylvaticus/juliatutorial">Github repository available here&lt;/a>), which by the way is listed in the &lt;a href="https://julialang.org/learning/tutorials/">Julia tutorials page&lt;/a>. IMHO, this is a good resource to get started with Julia (only a few hours to go through) as well as a good refresher course. Below I took some notes that should mainly act as a personal reminder, but might be useful for other.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
