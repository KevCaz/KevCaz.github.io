Debian back on it (I installed Ubuntu 22.04 to make it easier to use for a non-Linux user).
I went through all the installation seamlessly, but I was not able to have the wifi working. I knew it was related to &lt;code>firmware-iwlwifi&lt;/code>, but I was unable to install it.
As it turned out, the package was not available for bookworm (found this but looking at &lt;a href="https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=iwlwifi)">https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=iwlwifi)&lt;/a>, probably due to some bugs (see &lt;a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=firmware-iwlwifi;dist=unstable)">https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=firmware-iwlwifi;dist=unstable)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Debian Bookworm setup</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2022/05/2022-05-22_debian_bookworm_setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2022/05/2022-05-22_debian_bookworm_setup/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently decided to re-install my computer and I took the opportunity to
create a &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/">gist&lt;/a> that includes light version of my
Debian 11 set-up, i.e. all the tools I used the most. Once again during the
install (I use a &lt;a href="https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/">Debian weekly build installation
image&lt;/a>) did not keep things
light as I let several pieces of software be installed during the setup (e.g.
LibreOffice, Inkscape). So here goes the 4th version of my bash script to
install Debian on my Lenovo T470p &amp;#x2b07;&amp;#xfe0f;. It works well, as always!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use flatpak!</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2021/02/2021-02-10_use_flatpak/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2021/02/2021-02-10_use_flatpak/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two days ago, I was attempting to install &lt;a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">GNOME Fractal&lt;/a> but &lt;code>apt-get&lt;/code> couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it&amp;hellip; Cause it&amp;rsquo;s a GNOME application I thought is was unexpected, so I checked the &lt;a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal">README file&lt;/a>. It turned out that the developers actually suggest to install their app with either &lt;a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snap&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak&lt;/a>. As I knew about the former and hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard about the later, I decided to install flatpak.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div style="color:#575279;background-color:#faf4ed;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>I then used flatpak to install Fractal. I must stress that the installation was seamless and that the information displayed during it was clear and helpful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migrating from Buster to Bullseye</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2020/09/2020-09-18_migrating_from_buster/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2020/09/2020-09-18_migrating_from_buster/</guid><description>&lt;p>In July 2019, &lt;a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/2019/msg00003.html">Buster became the stable release of
Debian&lt;/a> and the
Bullseye became &lt;em>de facto&lt;/em> the new testing distribution. After spending almost 2
years on Buster, I decided last week that it was time to migrate to Bullseye.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="backing-up">Backing up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I frequently backup my files (so far with a simple bash function that copies
them to my external hard drive). Plus, I also have a &lt;i class="fab fa-github"
aria-hidden="true">&lt;/i> repository,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/KevCaz/dotfiles">dotfiles&lt;/a>, where I stored my configuration
files (the ones I can share). Before the migration, I created a separate backup
with my regular files and as many configuration files as possible (for instance
I backed up my &lt;code>.local&lt;/code> folder). For this migration, I was eager to learn how to
backup my GNOME keybindings as well as the GNOME terminal profiles I used.
Turned out I only needed one command: &lt;code>dconf&lt;/code> &lt;a href="https://developer.gnome.org/dconf/unstable/dconf-overview.html">see this page on
developer.gnome.org&lt;/a>
that I used as follows:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dual Boot MacOS-Ubuntu</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/07/2019-07-16_dual_boot_macos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/07/2019-07-16_dual_boot_macos/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="context">Context&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I must say that I have been quite unhappy with my old Mac Book Pro (mid 2012)
for almost a year now. IIRC, I got it early 2013 and it served me well during my
PhD but now it is kind of slow &amp;#x1f422; and often behaves weirdly on boot. Last
weekend fir instance, I got a nasty black screen on boot &amp;#x1f631;. Turns out it
happens frequently and there are no less than &lt;a href="http://osxdaily.com/2014/11/22/fix-macbook-pro-booting-black-screen/">four different solutions to this
issue
&amp;#x1f631;&lt;/a>
(in my case, emptying the PRAM did the job)&amp;hellip; Windows, MacOS, blue screen,
black screen, yunno&amp;hellip; I found having these issues actually rather worrisome
because I care about my computer, I update it frequently and I&amp;rsquo;m actually
capable of solving this kind of issues, so WTF? This whole situation makes me
wonder what people unable to deal with this kind of problem would do&amp;hellip; My guess
is they would go to an fancy Apple store to either get it fixed &amp;#x1f4b0; or
get a new shinny Mac &amp;#x1f4b0;&amp;#x1f4b0;&amp;#x1f4b0;! Anyway, as the time went on, I started to feel frustrated and as I was not a big fan of &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/fr/macos/mojave/">MacOS Mojave&lt;/a> (it brings nothing I need and I haven&amp;rsquo;t noted any improvement). Given this I decided:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Raspberry Pi 3B</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/07/2019-07-12_my_raspberry_pi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/07/2019-07-12_my_raspberry_pi/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two years ago now, I bought myself a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pi
3B&lt;/a> (back in 2015, I bought a model
2B and since June of this year, &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">model 4B is
out&lt;/a> but has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20688655/raspberry-pi-4-usb-c-port-bug-e-marked-cables-audio-accessory-charging">some

Even if don&amp;rsquo;t use it as much as I would like to, this small computer never
ceases to amaze me! The concept is awesome, the education goals are meaningful

so I searched for some information on the Internet. As expected it was hard
to find reliable sources of information among websites that are obviously not
neutral. After a few hours on the net, I ended up buying a &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470p-Core-i7-GeForce-940MX-Laptop-Review.226802.0.html">Lenovo ThinkPad T470p&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://insileco.github.io/2018/01/21/setting-my-debian-stretch-up/">installed Debian on&lt;/a>,
so far so good, very happy I made this choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I am on several Debian mailing lists, it actually seems that Debian
users generally appreciate Lenovo as a brand and more particularly the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad">ThinkPad&lt;/a> line of laptop. I retain
some advice from the mails Debian users are exchanging:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
