Basically, I was not able to install the latest kernel because I was running out of boot space. As it turned out, the previous kernel images were kept and as I had only 700Â Mb of boot space (/boot partition), after stacking a few images (most of them were OEM kernels) I was not able to update the kernel.</description></item></channel></rss>
