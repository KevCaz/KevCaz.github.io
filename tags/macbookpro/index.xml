IIRC, I got it early 2013 and it served me well during my PhD but now it is kind of slow üê¢ and often behaves weirdly on boot. Last weekend fir instance, I got a nasty black screen on boot üò±. Turns out it happens frequently and there are no less than four different solutions to this issue üò± (in my case, emptying the PRAM did the job)&amp;hellip; Windows, MacOS, blue screen, black screen, yunno&amp;hellip; I found having these issues actually rather worrisome because I care about my computer, I update it frequently and I&amp;rsquo;m actually capable of solving this kind of issues, so WTF?</description></item></channel></rss>
