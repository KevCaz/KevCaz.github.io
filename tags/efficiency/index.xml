1 2 3 $ Rscript --no-site-file -e &amp;#39;blogdown::serve_site()&amp;#39; /usr/lib/R/bin/R: line 193: /usr/bin/sed: No such file or directory ERROR: option &amp;#39;-e&amp;#39; requires a non-empty argument I did not understand what happened so I decided to google it! The bug was already identified and reported 😄. A side note to mention that several packages now imports callr (for instance pkgdown) and as it uses the R command wrapper (if I understand correctly) the current bug actually affects several different packages.</description></item><item><title>Make your conditional statements efficient!</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/r/efficientif/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/r/efficientif/</guid><description>Recently, I was looking at an R function and found a if statement that looks something like this:
1 2 3 if (length(which(names(df) == &amp;#34;entry&amp;#34;)) &amp;gt; 0) { # [...] } I guess this is common way of doing it as it matches well with a way of looking at the problem: &amp;ldquo;if I want to test the presence of a column &amp;ldquo;entry&amp;rdquo; in a data frame (df), I can check if there is more at least one name that match &amp;ldquo;entry&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
