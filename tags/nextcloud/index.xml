I basically went through the steps described in my previous note &lt;a href="https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2022/01/2022-01-05_nextcloud_server_on/" title="Go to this post">&amp;lsquo;Nextcloud server on a Raspberry Pi 3B&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a> and I turned them into a playbook. If you want to get an idea of what is Ansible, check out the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)">Wikipedia article&lt;/a> and for what follows, let&amp;rsquo;s keep in mind the following:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nextcloud server on a Raspberry Pi 3B</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2022/01/2022-01-05_nextcloud_server_on/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2022/01/2022-01-05_nextcloud_server_on/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have already written elsewhere all the good that I think about Raspberry Pi. It is a fantastic project supported by a great community. I personally own a &lt;a href="../../notes/rapsberrypi/raspberrypi3b/">Rapsberry Pi model 3B&lt;/a> and so far I have been using it for several small projects. For more than a year I have been thinking about running some small services on my Raspberry Pi, but never took the time to set it up. I finally took Christmas time to do it and I started with &lt;a href="https://nextcloud.com/">NextCloud&lt;/a>. This post summarizes the different installation steps I went through to get a NextCloud server running on my Raspberry Pi. Note that I do not intend to provide a walk-through for the installation, I rather explain what needs to be done, give some commands and point to online documentation and tutorials. There are plenty of good tutorials available on line, notably the ones by &lt;a href="https://pimylifeup.com/">Pi My Life Up&lt;/a>, I don&amp;rsquo;t think they need to be duplicated!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
