For numerous movies and TV shows, it is relatively easy to find subtitles files online (mainly as .srt files, i.e. SubRip files), but that is not true for all contents!
When I thought about automating the generation of subtitles for a minute, I was convinced that with a tool to extract the audio from a movie file and a trained AI model that would generate the transcript, it should be doable to automate the process.</description></item></channel></rss>
