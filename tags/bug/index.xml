I tried to understand what was the problem but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to figure it out. After a while, I decided to uninstall Thunderbird and reinstall it. Things just got worst I couldn&amp;rsquo;t set any of my email accounts. For my Gmail, I tried to use &lt;a href="https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/protocol-oauth2">OAuth2&lt;/a>, as it is &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1269204">recommended&lt;/a> (it used to work for me), but the identification protocol did not work: instead of getting the Gmail interface to login, I got an error message pointing out a lack of security (&lt;code>NS_ERROR_NET_INADEQUATE_SECURITY&lt;/code>)&amp;hellip; As I did not understand why, I decided to stop speeding time on trying to find the origin of the problem. All I can say if that it should be related with the latest patch, &lt;a href="https://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs//main/t/thunderbird/thunderbird_78.11.0-1_changelog">78.11.0-1&lt;/a> (and my setup, I guess).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
