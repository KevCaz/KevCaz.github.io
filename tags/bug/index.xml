I tried to understand what was the problem but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to figure it out. After a while, I decided to uninstall Thunderbird and reinstall it. Things just got worst I couldn&amp;rsquo;t set any of my email accounts. For my Gmail, I tried to use OAuth2, as it is recommended (it used to work for me), but the identification protocol did not work: instead of getting the Gmail interface to login, I got an error message pointing out a lack of security (NS_ERROR_NET_INADEQUATE_SECURITY)&amp;hellip; As I did not understand why, I decided to stop speeding time on trying to find the origin of the problem.</description></item></channel></rss>
