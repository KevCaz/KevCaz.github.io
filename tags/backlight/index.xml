&lt;p>In order to celebrate, I thought it would be appropriate to write about something spooky &amp;#x1f47b;! So, as far as I remember, when I first installed Debian on my Lenovo T470p everything was OK, all the buttons were behaving just as expected, but, after a hibernation, the screen backlight buttons where not working anymore &amp;#x1f631;. Even more frightening, since that time, I am not able to change the intensity of the screen backlight from &lt;a href="https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-gnome-control-center/">GNOME control center&lt;/a> and since recently I have the same issue for the keyboard backlight &amp;#x1f631;.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
