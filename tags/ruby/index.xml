This web site for instance, is first checked on Travis CI and then deployed to GitHub pages, which is way more convenient than using FileZilla.

We (I was not the only one on board) decided to use the GitHub pages with Jekyll and one of the existing them, minima, that is we opt for using gh-pages the easiest way.</description></item></channel></rss>
