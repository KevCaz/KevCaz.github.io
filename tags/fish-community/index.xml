&lt;p>What happened to fish communities in Ontario lakes over the last few decades? We
have been relentlessly looking for answers to this question! Indeed, we did our
best to determine whether global change has affected those communities over the
last 40 years. It turns out that fish communities in Ontario lakes are pretty
different from what they were, but climate change does not explain those changes
&amp;#x1f4a5;! But, but… how can we say that? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s the topic of this post &amp;#x1f609;.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
