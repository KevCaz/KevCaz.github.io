As it turned out, it was an actual bug that has been reported. Shortly after the report, a work around has been proposed, and the new patch uploaded last Sunday (2021/06/29) solves all the issues I encountered. So everything is back to normal!

Since that time, things have gotten worst as I was no longer able to get hyperlinks opening the corresponding page in my web browser ðŸ˜±. I did not look for a fix, I simply coped with it waiting for an update.</description></item></channel></rss>
