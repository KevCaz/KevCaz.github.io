I have been meaning to read it for at least 5 years and I am very happy I finally took the time to read The Pragmatic Programmer, a book regarded as one of most influential among software engineers. As it turned out, it was a good thing to wait those 5 years because since the authors have released a new edition in 2020, for the 20th anniversary of the book.</description></item></channel></rss>
