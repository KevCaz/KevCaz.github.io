&lt;p>I have been meaning to read it for at least 5 years and I am very happy I
finally took the time to read &lt;a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/">&lt;em>The Pragmatic Programmer&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, a book regarded as one of most &lt;a href="https://jasonroell.com/2015/03/16/12-most-infuential-books-every-software-engineer-needs-to-read/">influential among software engineers&lt;/a>. As it turned out, it was a good thing to wait those 5 years because since the authors have released a new edition in 2020, for the 20&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> anniversary of the book. According to the authors, the book has been substantially edited to reflect the (massive) changes that have happened in the software industry over the past 20 years, so, overall I am reading an updated classic which I bet was even more useful!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
