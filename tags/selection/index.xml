I remember the first I used such feature, it was on &lt;a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text&lt;/a>, it blew my mind. I now use it pretty much everyday, and I have noticed that this is now a common feature among editors/IDEs, for instance, R users can use it in &lt;a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2015/05/06/rstudio-v0-99-preview-more-editor-enhancements/">RStudio&lt;/a>. Many time I hoped that a version of the multiple cursor would exist where it would be possible to set a sequence of number, I even thought that I should do it. Well, I must admit that I have never looked up for the existence of such feature until recently and guess what&amp;hellip; it already exists!! Check
