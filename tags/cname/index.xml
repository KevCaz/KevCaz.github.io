&lt;p>I am maintaining the website of the &lt;a href="https://mccannlab.ca/">McCann Lab&lt;/a> that is
currently hosted on the &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages&lt;/a>. Since I set
up the &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">custom
domain&lt;/a>,
I was experiencing a weird issue: after every single deployment even on GitHub
Pages (originally done by Travis, now by using &lt;a href="https://github.com/McCannLab/McCannLab.github.io/actions">a dedicated GitHub Actions
workflow&lt;/a>) the
custom domain was removed and I had to rewrite it every time (see &amp;#x2b07;&amp;#xfe0f;)
which was pretty annoying.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="the-solution-medal_sports">The solution &amp;#x1f3c5;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Truth be told, it was not difficult to find the solution! It was already
reported several times (including this issue on GitHub
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages/issues/213">gh-pages/issues/213&lt;/a>).
Basically, one needs to include a &lt;strong>CNAME&lt;/strong> file with the custom domain name
and for &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> (the static site generator I use for this
website), this file should be added in the &lt;code>static&lt;/code> folder. This is actually
well-explained in the
&lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#use-a-custom-domain">documentation&lt;/a>, so once again, read the doc!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
