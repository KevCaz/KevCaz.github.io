I went through all the installation seamlessly, but I was not able to have the wifi working. I knew it was related to firmware-iwlwifi, but I was unable to install it. As it turned out, the package was not available for bookworm (found this but looking at https://packages.</description></item><item><title>Debian Bookworm setup</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2022/05/2022-05-22_debian_bookworm_setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2022/05/2022-05-22_debian_bookworm_setup/</guid><description>I recently decided to re-install my computer and I took the opportunity to create a gist that includes light version of my Debian 11 set-up, i.e. all the tools I used the most. Once again during the install (I use a Debian weekly build installation image) did not keep things light as I let several pieces of software be installed during the setup (e.g. LibreOffice, Inkscape). So here goes the 4th version of my bash script to install Debian on my Lenovo T470p &amp;#x2b07;&amp;#xfe0f;.</description></item><item><title>From Bullseye to Bookworm</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2021/08/2021-08-29_from_bullseye_to/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2021/08/2021-08-29_from_bullseye_to/</guid><description>Two weeks ago, Bullseye became the new stable Debian release. As I prefer using Debian testing, today, I jumped on Debian 12 codenamed Bookworm. To do so, I simply updated my source list by replacing instances of bullseye by bookworm, and then I used the combo apt update/ apt upgrade.

I tried to understand what was the problem but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to figure it out. After a while, I decided to uninstall Thunderbird and reinstall it. Things just got worst I couldn&amp;rsquo;t set any of my email accounts. For my Gmail, I tried to use OAuth2, as it is recommended (it used to work for me), but the identification protocol did not work: instead of getting the Gmail interface to login, I got an error message pointing out a lack of security (NS_ERROR_NET_INADEQUATE_SECURITY)&amp;hellip; As I did not understand why, I decided to stop speeding time on trying to find the origin of the problem.</description></item><item><title>Migrating from Buster to Bullseye</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2020/09/2020-09-18_migrating_from_buster/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2020/09/2020-09-18_migrating_from_buster/</guid><description>In July 2019, Buster became the stable release of Debian and the Bullseye became de facto the new testing distribution. After spending almost 2 years on Buster, I decided last week that it was time to migrate to Bullseye.
Backing up I frequently backup my files (so far with a simple bash function that copies them to my external hard drive). Plus, I also have a repository, dotfiles, where I stored my configuration files (the ones I can share).</description></item><item><title>SageMath version 8.6 on Debian Buster</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/07/2019-07-18_sagemath_version_8/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/07/2019-07-18_sagemath_version_8/</guid><description>This is a short note to follow up on a previous one where I reported the steps to install the latest release of Sage using the GitHub repository. At that time Sage version 8.3 was not available on Debian Buster but now version 8.6 is available on Buster!

IIRC, I got it early 2013 and it served me well during my PhD but now it is kind of slow &amp;#x1f422; and often behaves weirdly on boot. Last weekend fir instance, I got a nasty black screen on boot &amp;#x1f631;. Turns out it happens frequently and there are no less than four different solutions to this issue &amp;#x1f631; (in my case, emptying the PRAM did the job)&amp;hellip; Windows, MacOS, blue screen, black screen, yunno&amp;hellip; I found having these issues actually rather worrisome because I care about my computer, I update it frequently and I&amp;rsquo;m actually capable of solving this kind of issues, so WTF?</description></item><item><title>My Raspberry Pi 3B</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/07/2019-07-12_my_raspberry_pi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/07/2019-07-12_my_raspberry_pi/</guid><description>Two years ago now, I bought myself a Raspberry Pi 3B (back in 2015, I bought a model 2B and since June of this year, model 4B is out but has some issues).

After a frozen period that lasted a few months, buster is the new stable Debian distribution since yesterday!
What does this change on my end? Not much! Basically, as I was already using buster in my /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ file, when I used apt-get update I got the following message:

Yesterday, I decided to install R 3.6.0 on my computer, so I used them, which basically means that:
I appended deb http://cran.wu.ac.at/bin/linux/debian buster-cran35/ to /etc/apt/sources.list; I added the key to configure the secure apt.</description></item><item><title>Get docker on Debian Testing</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/01/2019-01-07_get_docker_on/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/01/2019-01-07_get_docker_on/</guid><description>One of my resolutions for 2019 is to use docker to delve deeper into reproducible science. As explained in the Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s article about docker:
Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as &amp;ldquo;containerization&amp;rdquo;.
Basically, instead of installing software in a way that very much likely depends on the Operating System (OS) you are using, you install docker (OS specific) and then you run command lines (not OS specific) to install the set of containers (software) you need.</description></item><item><title>Thunderbird v60.3.0 solves them all!</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/11/2018-11-08_thunderbird_v60_3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/11/2018-11-08_thunderbird_v60_3/</guid><description>As I mentioned in a previous note, when I installed the version 60.0-3 of Thunderbird I was no longer able to write new emails and so I had to downgrade to v.52.9.1.

So, as far as I remember, when I first installed Debian on my Lenovo T470p everything was OK, all the buttons were behaving just as expected, but, after a hibernation, the screen backlight buttons where not working anymore &amp;#x1f631;. Even more frightening, since that time, I am not able to change the intensity of the screen backlight from GNOME control center and since recently I have the same issue for the keyboard backlight &amp;#x1f631;.</description></item><item><title>One more scope in spell-check</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-26_one_more_scope/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-26_one_more_scope/</guid><description>I often use R markdown within Atom. By default, spell-check does not check .Rmd file and so I needed to add the corresponding scope to the list of grammars checked. It was a two steps process:
find the scope with the command: Log cursor scope (use the command-palette);
copy-paste the scope and add it to the list of scopes that are already checked.
