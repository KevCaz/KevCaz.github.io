As I use two different applications, I have similar but slightly different color schemes, which, weirdly enough, has been bugging me for a while&amp;hellip; That is why, a few days ago, I started to edit the color but looking a the them repository of the Atom theme I liked (e.g. &lt;a href="https://github.com/atom-material">Atom Material&lt;/a>) when I came to realize that someone should have already found a simple way to install several geeky themes. Turns out I was correct (not the hardest guess admittedly), the name of this project is &lt;a href="http://mayccoll.github.io/Gogh/">Gogh&lt;/a> (I dare assume it is a reference to Vincent van Gogh) and it is awesome &amp;#x1f603;!!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
