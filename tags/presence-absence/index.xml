&lt;h1 id="what-did-we-do">What did we do?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We basically went over 7 arguments to explain why the information in
co-occurrence cannot be taken as a proxy for ecological interactions. Before I
quickly review the list of arguments, there are two points worth mentioning
about those arguments. First, &lt;strong>we are discussing the inference of static
ecological networks from occurrence data with an optional set of abiotic
variables&lt;/strong>. Second, we have not tried to be exhaustive nor have we tried to
find the minimal set of the most general arguments. Rather, we opted for strong
arguments that would speak to a wide range of ecologists, which means that:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
