I personally use several pieces of it, for instance gtop and decktape and I install them with the dedicated package manager, namely npm.
A few days ago, I had a hard time installing decktape &amp;mdash; that I use to convert my HTML presentations to pdf files &amp;mdash; on my Debian Buster computer, and so I decided to do a fresh install of Node.</description></item></channel></rss>
