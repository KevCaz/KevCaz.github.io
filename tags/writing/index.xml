It actually makes a ton of sense to me as I write my manuscripts in Markdown and Atom is provided with many powerful features (specific packages, shortcuts, etc.) that once combined make my writing very efficient (I like to think so). Recently, Timoth√©e Poisot shared a very cool setup for academic writing with Atom.
As he does, I also enjoy autocomplete-bibtex and document-outline but I often get quite distracted by the preview and prefer working with a very minimalist environment, which is why I like the zen package so much!</description></item></channel></rss>
