Moreover, to write math I am now using Katex which is pretty fast compared to other math typesetting libraries!
Today, as I was doing some math on my blog, I realize that inline math was not rendered. At first I thought that this was a conflict between KaTeX and goldmark but actually, I needed to tweak the delimiters KaTeX option.</description></item></channel></rss>
