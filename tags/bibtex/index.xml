&lt;a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX&lt;/a> (or in a lightweight markup languages
that is converted into LaTeX at some point). In such case, it is quite
useful to let co-authors edit their own &lt;code>bib&lt;/code> file in order to store the references included in the part of the manuscript they are editing. One way to deal with several &lt;code>bib&lt;/code> files is to merge them into one &lt;code>bib&lt;/code> file before compiling the final document to &lt;code>pdf&lt;/code>. In this note, I exemplify how to do so.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
