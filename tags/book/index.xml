I am now comfortable with the Linux command line but still looking for ways to improve my skills. Recently, I stumbled into no starch press that offers a great selection of books and found out that several are available at the library.</description></item><item><title>The Pragmatic Programmer</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2021/06/2021-06-11_the_pragmatic_programmer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2021/06/2021-06-11_the_pragmatic_programmer/</guid><description>The Pragmatic Programmer, book cover of the 20th Anniversary Edition. I have been meaning to read it for at least 5 years and I am very happy I finally took the time to read The Pragmatic Programmer, a book regarded as one of most influential among software engineers. As it turned out, it was a good thing to wait those 5 years because since the authors have released a new edition in 2020, for the 20th anniversary of the book.</description></item></channel></rss>
