Good news everyone! This week, our &amp;ldquo;Labmnivory&amp;rdquo; paper led by Marie Gutgesell has been accepted in Bioscience. Therefore, the time has come to release the code we promised explicitly in the manuscript.
Code for theoretical investigations will be made available on GitHub and archive on Zenodo upon manuscript acceptance.
For reproducibility&amp;rsquo;s sake, we&amp;rsquo;ve structured our Julia scripts as a research compendium which so far has been hosted on GitHub, in a private repository.</description></item><item><title>Never too late to publish your code!</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/econotes/2020/biogeonet/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/econotes/2020/biogeonet/</guid><description>Since 2017, for every article I work on, I now do my best to release the code I used to obtain the results presented therein (see my research compendia in the software section). In my humble opinion, this is the least I can do cause the numerical part of a study (often a large part of my work) is relatively easy to reproduce, though it requires some time to master the tools to do so.</description></item></channel></rss>
