during lunch time) offered by Compute Canada dealing with
&lt;a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html">Slurm&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU
Parallel&lt;/a> and how to combine them. This
was a very useful and timely presentation for me (&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ysIaSWa157yiZ-ocX1jkAys1NkGgwolArSwCgAYCUPQ/edit?ts=5dc04169#slide=id.g65b5e056e3_0_5">&amp;#x1f1eb;&amp;#x1f1f7; slides available online

topic&lt;/a>) and was eager to learn more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Earlier today, I found an opportunity to put in practice what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned last
week. Indeed I needed to download hundreds of shapefiles (2 different kind of
shapefiles at 2 different for almost 120 years), extract values from them before
deleting them. To do so, I wrote the following bash script to distribute the
simulations on 5 nodes and use 4 CPUs per node:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
