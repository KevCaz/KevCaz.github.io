This was a very useful and timely presentation for me (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· slides available online ðŸ”—) as I&amp;rsquo;ve just got started with Slurm (see my previous notes on the topic) and was eager to learn more.
Earlier today, I found an opportunity to put in practice what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned last week.</description></item></channel></rss>
