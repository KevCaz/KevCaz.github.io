I basically went through the steps described in my previous note &amp;lsquo;Nextcloud server on a Raspberry Pi 3B&amp;rsquo; and I turned them into a playbook. If you want to get an idea of what is Ansible, check out the Wikipedia article and for what follows, let&amp;rsquo;s keep in mind the following:</description></item><item><title>Basic Git server on my Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/raspberrypi/git_server_ssh/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/raspberrypi/git_server_ssh/</guid><description>As mentioned in my previous post, I have recently started using my Raspberry Pi as a server and I decided to try to host a basic Git server.
