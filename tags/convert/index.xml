The problem For the latest paper we&amp;rsquo;ve submitted, the journal required figures in EPS, but all the figures I&amp;rsquo;ve had created were in SVG. That really puzzled me! Why on earth forcing authors to submit in EPS? At the very least the journal policy should allow authors to submit in other vector formats&amp;hellip; I actually think this is rather problematic because 1.</description></item><item><title>Color and rotate an image with ImageMagick</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/12/2019-12-02_color_and_rotate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/12/2019-12-02_color_and_rotate/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve already written about ImageMagick in previous notes (e.g. this one about image resizing). Yesterday I used convert to color and rotate an image and I would like to show how simple it is here. Note that in order to show what the different command lines yield, I&amp;rsquo;ve used the PNG file of the GitHub Octocat (Octocat.png) available at https://github.com/logos.
Octocat.png To fill Octocat.png with black, I&amp;rsquo;ve used the following command line:</description></item><item><title>Memory issue with ImageMagick</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/08/2019-08-26_memory_issue_with/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/08/2019-08-26_memory_issue_with/</guid><description>Today, I was combining a set of images like so:
1 $ convert -append figP*.png out.png when I got error stating that cache resources exhausted. I was first surprised because it was the same set of images I combined a couple of days before EXCEPT that I significantly increased their resolution. So I googled the error message and found this issue on the GitHub repository of ImageMagick.
Well, turns out it was not a issue at all, I simply needed to change the memory limit as explained here and well summarized in the issue:</description></item><item><title>Combine images with ImageMagick</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/05/2019-05-16_combine_images_with/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/05/2019-05-16_combine_images_with/</guid><description>I do love create figures with R, I found quite satisfying to make them very personalized, yet reproducible! However I sometime wish that combining two plots was easier (as it often requires to build larges matrices and crazy layout() calls). I was looking for a simple way to do basic combinations of customized R figures, and I stumbled on this discussion on showing how easy it is to do so with ImageMagick.</description></item></channel></rss>
