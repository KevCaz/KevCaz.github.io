In my humble opinion, this is the least I can do cause the numerical part of a study (often a large part of my work) is relatively easy to reproduce, though it requires some time to master the tools to do so.</description></item><item><title>Count your lines of code with `cloc`</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/cloc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/cloc/</guid><description>I recently found out about cloc that is a very useful command line tool written in Perl that &amp;ldquo;counts blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming languages&amp;rdquo;1. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it works üëÅ.
The first step is to install cloc, there are several ways to do so, as a Debian user (Debian Buster) all I had to do was to use apt-get:
1 $ apt-get install cloc Once installed, cloc can be call in a Terminal like so: cloc path/to/file_or_folder.</description></item><item><title>My programming fonts!</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/font/font4code/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/font/font4code/</guid><description>Given that I spend most of my working time on a code editor (including to write papers), I regard the choice of the font as quite important. To me, a programming font must be monospaced (programming without a monospaced font is quite challenging) and appeal to me (a matter of readability and aesthetic I guess).
There are tons of fonts nowadays and it is quite easy to create your own (see for instance fontstruc), so the choice is wide!</description></item></channel></rss>
