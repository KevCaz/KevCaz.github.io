&lt;p>As mentioned several times on this website, I use &lt;a href="https://atom.io/">Atom&lt;/a> for
my coding as well as for writing posts and manuscripts. While coding, one often
needs to run commands in a terminal. To do so, I use specific Atom packages such
as &lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/ide-r">IDE-R&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-julia-client">Julia
Client&lt;/a> to run R and Julia
commands respectively and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/platformio/platformio-atom-ide-terminal">platformio-ide-terminal&lt;/a>.
The latter meets most of my expectations, but:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>the terminal emulated is in a bottom panel and when I&amp;rsquo;m working on my laptop I cannot get a good overview of the code and the corresponding outputs at the same time, pretty annoying&amp;hellip; and having the terminal in the right panel is a &lt;a href="https://github.com/platformio/platformio-atom-ide-terminal/issues/198">feature unlikely to be implemented in a near future&lt;/a>;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prompt before opening larges file in Atom</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-29_prompt_before_opening/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-29_prompt_before_opening/</guid><description>&lt;p>Many of the projects I am working on include files that are over 5Mo. When
I am working with &lt;a href="https://atom.io/">Atom&lt;/a> I often click on them (wrongly)
and this used to make Atom work hard for nothing &amp;#x1f61e;.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the screencast above, for instance, I had to wait for 1 minute to be able
to work again, although the file was 5 MB only (atom 1.30.0 for the record).
I did not have such issue with &lt;code>.csv&lt;/code> files as I was using &lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/tablr">tablr&lt;/a>
that prompts a message before opening the file. From there I knew that
what I needed was to make Atom prompt a message before opening large files.
This was actually &lt;a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10086">already implemented&lt;/a>
&amp;#x1f604; all I had to do was change the default value (40 MB), I set it
to 1 MB.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>One more scope in spell-check</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-26_one_more_scope/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-26_one_more_scope/</guid><description>&lt;p>I often use &lt;a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R markdown&lt;/a> within &lt;a href="https://atom.io/">Atom&lt;/a>.
By default, spell-check does not check &lt;code>.Rmd&lt;/code> file and so I needed to add the
corresponding scope to the list of grammars checked. It was a two steps process:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>find the scope with the command: &lt;code>Log cursor scope&lt;/code> (use the &lt;a href="https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/atom-basics/#command-palette">command-palette&lt;/a>);&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>copy-paste the scope and add it to the list of scopes that are already checked.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

It actually makes a ton of sense to me as I write my manuscripts in Markdown and
Atom is provided with many powerful features (specific packages, shortcuts, etc.) that once combined make my writing very efficient (I like to think so). Recently, Timothée Poisot shared a very cool setup for academic writing with
Atom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As he does, I also enjoy &lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-bibtex">autocomplete-bibtex&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/document-outline">document-outline&lt;/a> but I often
get quite distracted by the &lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced">preview&lt;/a>
and prefer working with a very minimalist environment, which is why I like &lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/Zen">the zen package&lt;/a> so much!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I love the 'multi-cursor-increment' package</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-19_i_love_the/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-19_i_love_the/</guid><description>&lt;p>I truly like the &lt;a href="https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/editing-and-deleting-text/#multiple-cursors-and-selections">multiple cursors in Atom&lt;/a>. I remember the first I used such feature, it was on &lt;a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text&lt;/a>, it blew my mind. I now use it pretty much everyday, and I have noticed that this is now a common feature among editors/IDEs, for instance, R users can use it in &lt;a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2015/05/06/rstudio-v0-99-preview-more-editor-enhancements/">RStudio&lt;/a>. Many time I hoped that a version of the multiple cursor would exist where it would be possible to set a sequence of number, I even thought that I should do it. Well, I must admit that I have never looked up for the existence of such feature until recently and guess what&amp;hellip; it already exists!! Check
&lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/multi-cursor-increment">the multi-cursor-increment package&lt;/a> out!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use regex mode to efficiently find and replace in a specific folder with Atom</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-17_use_regex_mode/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-17_use_regex_mode/</guid><description>&lt;p>One specific feature of &lt;a href="https://atom.io/">Atom&lt;/a> I like is the &amp;ldquo;find and replace&amp;rdquo; for a specific folder (&lt;code>ctrl+shift+F&lt;/code> by default on Debian).
It could be extremely powerful when the &lt;a href="https://regexr.com/">regex&lt;/a> mode is on.
Let me give you an example. Yesterday I had to replace all &lt;code>\code{sometext}&lt;/code>
with &lt;code>'sometext'&lt;/code> which represented dozens of matches in several files.
Well, it was not hard at all! All I had to do once the regex mode was on (see
where the pointer is on the image below) was to remember the right
regex:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>More than one langage with spell-check</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-11_more_than_one/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-11_more_than_one/</guid><description>&lt;p>I spend most on my coding and writing time on &lt;a href="https://atom.io/">Atom&lt;/a> and as
I write in both English and French I use two dictionaries with &lt;a href="https://github.com/atom/spell-check">spell-check&lt;/a>.
Well, it actually took me a while to understand how to use two different locales
on my Debian machine simply because I was lazy enough to not read the &lt;a href="https://github.com/atom/spell-check#debian-ubuntu-and-mint">README
on the Github repository of spell-check&lt;/a>.
Out of curiosity, I checked out what &lt;a href="http://hunspell.github.io/">hunspell&lt;/a> is
(note that the project is hosted on &lt;a href="https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell">Github&lt;/a>)
and then I checked the dictionaries currently installed on my device:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
