Good news everyone! This week, our &amp;ldquo;Labmnivory&amp;rdquo; paper led by Marie Gutgesell has been accepted in Bioscience. Therefore, the time has come to release the code we promised explicitly in the manuscript.
Code for theoretical investigations will be made available on GitHub and archive on Zenodo upon manuscript acceptance.
For reproducibility&amp;rsquo;s sake, we&amp;rsquo;ve structured our Julia scripts as a research compendium which so far has been hosted on GitHub, in a private repository.</description></item></channel></rss>
