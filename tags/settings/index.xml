When
I am working with &lt;a href="https://atom.io/">Atom&lt;/a> I often click on them (wrongly)
and this used to make Atom work hard for nothing &amp;#x1f61e;.&lt;/p>

&lt;/center>

&lt;p>In the screencast above, for instance, I had to wait for 1 minute to be able
to work again, although the file was 5 MB only (atom 1.30.0 for the record).
I did not have such issue with &lt;code>.csv&lt;/code> files as I was using &lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/tablr">tablr&lt;/a>
that prompts a message before opening the file. From there I knew that
what I needed was to make Atom prompt a message before opening large files.
This was actually &lt;a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10086">already implemented&lt;/a>
&amp;#x1f604; all I had to do was change the default value (40 MB), I set it
to 1 MB.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
