It actually makes a ton of sense to me as I write my manuscripts in Markdown and
Atom is provided with many powerful features (specific packages, shortcuts, etc.) that once combined make my writing very efficient (I like to think so). Recently, Timothée Poisot shared a very cool setup for academic writing with
Atom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As he does, I also enjoy &lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-bibtex">autocomplete-bibtex&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/document-outline">document-outline&lt;/a> but I often
get quite distracted by the &lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced">preview&lt;/a>
and prefer working with a very minimalist environment, which is why I like &lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/Zen">the zen package&lt;/a> so much!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use regex mode to efficiently find and replace in a specific folder with Atom</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-17_use_regex_mode/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-17_use_regex_mode/</guid><description>&lt;p>One specific feature of &lt;a href="https://atom.io/">Atom&lt;/a> I like is the &amp;ldquo;find and replace&amp;rdquo; for a specific folder (&lt;code>ctrl+shift+F&lt;/code> by default on Debian).
It could be extremely powerful when the &lt;a href="https://regexr.com/">regex&lt;/a> mode is on.
Let me give you an example. Yesterday I had to replace all &lt;code>\code{sometext}&lt;/code>
with &lt;code>'sometext'&lt;/code> which represented dozens of matches in several files.
Well, it was not hard at all! All I had to do once the regex mode was on (see
where the pointer is on the image below) was to remember the right
regex:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
