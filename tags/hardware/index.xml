&lt;p>I must say that I have been quite unhappy with my old Mac Book Pro (mid 2012)
for almost a year now. IIRC, I got it early 2013 and it served me well during my
PhD but now it is kind of slow &amp;#x1f422; and often behaves weirdly on boot. Last
weekend fir instance, I got a nasty black screen on boot &amp;#x1f631;. Turns out it
happens frequently and there are no less than &lt;a href="http://osxdaily.com/2014/11/22/fix-macbook-pro-booting-black-screen/">four different solutions to this
issue
&amp;#x1f631;&lt;/a>
(in my case, emptying the PRAM did the job)&amp;hellip; Windows, MacOS, blue screen,
black screen, yunno&amp;hellip; I found having these issues actually rather worrisome
because I care about my computer, I update it frequently and I&amp;rsquo;m actually
capable of solving this kind of issues, so WTF? This whole situation makes me
wonder what people unable to deal with this kind of problem would do&amp;hellip; My guess
is they would go to an fancy Apple store to either get it fixed &amp;#x1f4b0; or
get a new shinny Mac &amp;#x1f4b0;&amp;#x1f4b0;&amp;#x1f4b0;! Anyway, as the time went on, I started to feel frustrated and as I was not a big fan of &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/fr/macos/mojave/">MacOS Mojave&lt;/a> (it brings nothing I need and I haven&amp;rsquo;t noted any improvement). Given this I decided:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Raspberry Pi 3B</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/07/2019-07-12_my_raspberry_pi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/07/2019-07-12_my_raspberry_pi/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two years ago now, I bought myself a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pi
3B&lt;/a> (back in 2015, I bought a model
2B and since June of this year, &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">model 4B is
out&lt;/a> but has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20688655/raspberry-pi-4-usb-c-port-bug-e-marked-cables-audio-accessory-charging">some
issues&lt;/a>).
Even if don&amp;rsquo;t use it as much as I would like to, this small computer never
ceases to amaze me! The concept is awesome, the education goals are meaningful
and timely and the community is great, just check out the official website

&lt;p>In order to celebrate, I thought it would be appropriate to write about something spooky &amp;#x1f47b;! So, as far as I remember, when I first installed Debian on my Lenovo T470p everything was OK, all the buttons were behaving just as expected, but, after a hibernation, the screen backlight buttons where not working anymore &amp;#x1f631;. Even more frightening, since that time, I am not able to change the intensity of the screen backlight from &lt;a href="https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-gnome-control-center/">GNOME control center&lt;/a> and since recently I have the same issue for the keyboard backlight &amp;#x1f631;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Lenovo T470p</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-14_my_lenovo_t470p/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/09/2018-09-14_my_lenovo_t470p/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I switched from MacOS to Debian, I had no idea what laptop to buy
so I searched for some information on the Internet. As expected it was hard
to find reliable sources of information among websites that are obviously not
neutral. After a few hours on the net, I ended up buying a &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470p-Core-i7-GeForce-940MX-Laptop-Review.226802.0.html">Lenovo ThinkPad T470p&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://insileco.github.io/2018/01/21/setting-my-debian-stretch-up/">installed Debian on&lt;/a>,
so far so good, very happy I made this choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I am on several Debian mailing lists, it actually seems that Debian
users generally appreciate Lenovo as a brand and more particularly the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad">ThinkPad&lt;/a> line of laptop. I retain
some advice from the mails Debian users are exchanging:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
