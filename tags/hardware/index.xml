IIRC, I got it early 2013 and it served me well during my PhD but now it is kind of slow üê¢ and often behaves weirdly on boot. Last weekend fir instance, I got a nasty black screen on boot üò±. Turns out it happens frequently and there are no less than four different solutions to this issue üò± (in my case, emptying the PRAM did the job)&amp;hellip; Windows, MacOS, blue screen, black screen, yunno&amp;hellip; I found having these issues actually rather worrisome because I care about my computer, I update it frequently and I&amp;rsquo;m actually capable of solving this kind of issues, so WTF?</description></item><item><title>My Raspberry Pi 3B</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/raspberrypi/raspberrypi3b/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/raspberrypi/raspberrypi3b/</guid><description>Two years ago now, I bought myself a Raspberry Pi 3B (back in 2015, I bought a model 2B and since June of this year, model 4B is out but has some issues). Even if don&amp;rsquo;t use it as much as I would like to, this small computer never ceases to amaze me! The concept is awesome, the education goals are meaningful and timely and the community is great, just check out the official website https://www.</description></item><item><title>And the backlight buttons stopped responding!</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/backlightgone/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/backlightgone/</guid><description>ü¶á Happy Halloween! ü¶á In order to celebrate, I thought it would be appropriate to write about something spooky üëª! So, as far as I remember, when I first installed Debian on my Lenovo T470p everything was OK, all the buttons were behaving just as expected, but, after a hibernation, the screen backlight buttons where not working anymore üò±. Even more frightening, since that time, I am not able to change the intensity of the screen backlight from GNOME control center and since recently I have the same issue for the keyboard backlight üò±.</description></item><item><title>My Lenovo T470p</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/lenovot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/lenovot/</guid><description>When I switched from MacOS to Debian, I had no idea what laptop to buy so I searched for some information on the Internet. As expected it was hard to find reliable sources of information among websites that are obviously not neutral. After a few hours on the net, I ended up buying a Lenovo ThinkPad T470p and installed Debian on, so far so good, very happy I made this choice.</description></item></channel></rss>
