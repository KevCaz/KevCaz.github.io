This was mainly a maintenance release following up on a recent issue in vcr (see &lt;a href="https://github.com/ropensci/vcr/issues/255">&lt;em>Overview of fixes for upcoming v1.2&lt;/em>&lt;/a>) but I also took the opportunity to improve the &lt;code>set_token()&lt;/code> function. Now the user has up to five attempts to set up the token when &lt;code>set_token()&lt;/code> is called, after that error is triggered (previously the error was triggered after the first failed attempt).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>R packages rmangal and rcites updated on CRAN</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2021/11/2021-11-25_r_packages_rmangal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2021/11/2021-11-25_r_packages_rmangal/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past few weeks, I took some time to review the unit tests for &lt;a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmangal">&lt;code>rmangal&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rcites">&lt;code>rcites&lt;/code>&lt;/a>. Both packages are R clients for web APIs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>rmangal&lt;/code> allows users to search ecological interactions available in the &lt;a href="https://mangal.io/#/">Mangal&lt;/a> database;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>rcites&lt;/code> allows users to query the Species+ database by leveraging the &lt;a href="https://api.speciesplus.net/documentation/v1.html">Speciesplus/CITES Checklist API&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One of the main challenges with such packages is to not get archived on CRAN &amp;#x1f631;! &lt;code>rmangal&lt;/code> was actually archived a year ago for policy violation on internet access, and so one of my main goals was to get it back on CRAN. I was relatively aware of ways to avoid using the Internet on CRAN as I had already used &lt;a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vcr">&lt;code>vcr&lt;/code>&lt;/a> for a small project, but I clearly needed to learn more to use it efficiently. Fortunately, &lt;a href="https://masalmon.eu/">Maëlle Salmon&lt;/a> had been working on a very useful book on the topic, &lt;a href="https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/">&lt;em>HTTP testing in R&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, that has a lot of valuable advice that helped me design my tests with &lt;a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vcr">&lt;code>vcr&lt;/code>&lt;/a>!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>rcites code coverage dropped to 0</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/10/2018-10-09_rcites_code_coverage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2018/10/2018-10-09_rcites_code_coverage/</guid><description>&lt;p>We (a couple of colleagues and myself) are currently finishing a major release
for our R package &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibartomeus/rcites">rcites&lt;/a>. After adding the latest
feature I have been working on via a pull request, I messed up with my local
master branch and overwrite/delete some files &amp;#x1f620;. I thought it was not
a big deal as all of them were files created/edited when the package is built (well, I
thought so). But after the very next push, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibartomeus/rcites/issues/37">the code coverage weirdly dropped to
zero&lt;/a> &amp;#x1f631;.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
