In my humble opinion, this is the least I can do cause the numerical part of a study (often a large part of my work) is relatively easy to reproduce, though it requires some time to master the tools to do so.</description></item><item><title>Towards an integrated theory of biogeography</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/econotes/2016/towards-an-integrated-theory-of-biogeography/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/econotes/2016/towards-an-integrated-theory-of-biogeography/</guid><description>Dominique Gravel, Nicolas Mouquet, David Mouillot and I have recently published a paper in Ecography entitled &amp;lsquo;On the integration of biotic interaction and environmental constraints at the biogeographical scale&amp;rsquo; where we develop some ideas about how ecological interactions and abiotic factors must be taken together into account to better predict species&amp;rsquo; distribution. As suggested during the editing process, we wrote a blog post for Ecography that summarizes our paper. I think blog posts are an useful way to promote one&amp;rsquo;s work and also a good compromise between reading the abstract and reading the entire paper.</description></item></channel></rss>
