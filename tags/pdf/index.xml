On the website I was told to use Acrobat Reader &amp;#x1f628;&amp;hellip; which is not supported on Linux. So I looked for an alternative to work on Debian 10, when I stumbled into this answer on mentioning Master PDF, so I installed it:
1 $ apt-get install master-pdf-editor and you know what? Worked like a charm! &amp;#x1f386;</description></item><item><title>Convert a pdf file to a text file with pdftotext</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/11/2019-11-04_convert_a_pdf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/11/2019-11-04_convert_a_pdf/</guid><description>Today I was asked whether I was aware of a way to extract a table from a pdf file. I actually knew about one CLI tool pdftotext &amp;#x1f517; that converts a pdf file to a text file and I had this memory that I had used it for tables in the past. pdftotext is developed by Glyph &amp;amp; Cog with several other CLI tools to manipulate pdf files and the pdf viewer Xpdf.</description></item><item><title>Combine multiple pdf files</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/10/2019-10-24_combine_multiple_pdf/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/10/2019-10-24_combine_multiple_pdf/</guid><description>For a recent job application, I needed to combine several pdf files into a single one and to number its pages afterwards. I already knew that I would be able to use PDFtk, a smart CLI tool I mentioned in a previous note to combine the pdf files, but I was not sure how to proceed for the page numbering. Turns out that PDFtk is also useful for this too!</description></item><item><title>Extract a range of pages from a pdf file</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/05/2019-05-30_extract_a_range/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/2019/05/2019-05-30_extract_a_range/</guid><description>Today, I was looking for a way to extract pages from a pdf file with the command line interface and stumbled on this answer on , and so I decided to try PDFtk.
