website. I decided to get a website when I was doing my PhD, back in 2014 (not a
100% about sure about the timeline), in order to share some of my work. With my
(very) modest skills I built a first website using CSS, HTML and a bit of PHP,
no framework of any sort, no static site generators either. It was hosted by
1and1 (which is now <a href=https://www.ionos.com/>Ionos</a>, apparently) and I used to
send updates to the server with <a href=https://filezilla-project.org/>FileZilla</a>. It
was a funny looking website&mldr; looked like a website from the 90&rsquo;s! Shame I
didn&rsquo;t take a screenshot! It lasted a year or so before I worked on a
second version.</p><p>In 2015, I rebuilt my personal website with <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/>Jekyll</a>,
which was a big improvement: I was able to write posts more efficiently because I
wrote them with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>Markdown</a> and I was
able to use GitHub to version my website (now <a href=https://github.com/KevCaz/KevCazWebsite>archived on
GitHub</a>) and to host it on <a href=https://pages.github.com/>GitHub
Pages</a>! I had a good experience with Jekyll, it made
me realize the power of static site generators. But I struggled a bit with
<a href=https://shopify.github.io/liquid/>Liquid</a> which, I guess, is the main reason why
I decided to try <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> out, which I have been using ever
since.</p><p>I created three different versions of my personal website with Hugo. The
learning curve was rather steep, but one step at a time, I managed to get used
to partials, shortcode, archetypes, etc. The documentation, including the great
<a href=https://www.mikedane.com/>tutorials by Mike Dane</a> (&lsquo;Giraffe Academy&rsquo; at the
time) were extremely helpful for this! I first used the <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/>&lsquo;Academic&rsquo;
theme</a> without any modification. It was well
suited for my needs and I was rather content with it, but at some point, I was
looking for more freedom and I decided to work on my skills to get such freedom.
So, for the second version (released in February 2018), I chose a very minimal
theme, <a href=https://xmin.yihui.org/>Hugo Xmin</a>, that I forked and tweaked in
<a href=https://github.com/KevCaz/hugo-KevCaz>KevCaz/hugo-KevCaz</a>. This was a good
mean to have a first experience with Hugo themes and this actually led me to
consider creating my own theme, which I did in the third Hugo version (so the
5<sup>th</sup> version total, released in February 2020), which is the one you
are looking at (well, at least if it is an update relatively close to <a href=https://github.com/KevCaz/KevCaz.github.io/commit/0ddcfc7556bd082b82ffdf953265cafc0932eee9>commit
<code>a2baec2</code></a>). I&rsquo;d like to share what I&rsquo;ve learned building this 5<sup>th</sup> version in what follows.</p><center><figure><img class=mg-bot src=./assets/look_012021.png width=100%><figcaption><div class="highlight justify"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden></i> Screenshot of the home page of this website (localhost, January 29<sup>th</sup> 2021, commit <a href=https://github.com/KevCaz/KevCaz.github.io/commit/0ddcfc7556bd082b82ffdf953265cafc0932eee9>a2baec2</a>)</div></figcaption></figure></center><h2 id=the-5supthsup-version>The 5<sup>th</sup> version</h2><p>My website is now an important tool for me to gather and structure some details
about my professional life, to showcase my work and to write blog posts. When I
built my Hugo theme I had several goals in mind to either make my website even
more tailored to my needs or to use specific technologies :</p><ul><li>I had a specific design in mind with two vertical navigation bars.</li><li>I wanted a fairly light theme (i.e. not relying on heavy external libraries/frameworks)</li><li>I was eager to use <a href=https://sass-lang.com/>Sass</a> (mainly to use variables in CSS)</li><li>I was looking for using as many Hugo features as possible!</li></ul><p>I achieved those goals by working a week or two on my theme: <a href=https://github.com/KevCaz/funkyflex>funkyflex</a> and now I feel that I really have a website tailored to my needs, let me tell you a bit more in the next sections.</p><h3 id=first-thing-the-design>First thing: the design</h3><p>I am glad that I thought about the design first, because it helped me build the website step by step with a clear goal for the visual rendering. In my mind,
I had to get the following design elements right:</p><ul><li>a main navigation bar on the left side,</li><li>no top navigation bar and no footer (actually this is only true for medium and large devices)</li><li>a secondary/contextual navigation bar to help navigating through the page content;</li><li>the home page had to include an academic mission statement</li></ul><p>By the way, I looked at various website to get ideas and I would like to mention the one by <a href=https://regisphilibert.com/fr/>RÃ©gis Philibert</a> because not only it contains great posts about Hugo, it also has an awesome design!</p><h3 id=new-htmlcssjavascript-knowledge>New HTML/CSS/Javascript knowledge</h3><p>I am pleased that I&rsquo;ve spent time learning <a href=https://sass-lang.com/>Sass</a>, using its features made my work with CSS way more efficient. The nice and clear <a href=https://grafikart.fr/tutoriels/sass>tutorials</a> by Garfikart (this French is a rock star!) made my learning of Sass super easy, and the integration <a href=https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/scss-sass/>Sass/Hugo</a> is already well documented! Have a look at the <a href=https://github.com/KevCaz/funkyflex/tree/master/assets/scss>assets/scss</a> folder of my theme to check out what I&rsquo;ve done!</p><p>I am also glad I took some time to learn a bit more about responsive web design and media queries. I have learned how to use <a href=https://grafikart.fr/tutoriels/flexbox-806>flexbox</a> which helped me make my theme lighter as I didn&rsquo;t need to rely on external frameworks (such as Boostrap), which is pretty neat!</p><p>At some point, I asked some friends how to attach more infos to a URL. Doesn&rsquo;t make sense, right? Well that was my way of describing it&mldr; you know, on many platforms nowadays (e.g. Slack), when a URL is shared, it often comes with a text and/or an image! Turns out this is a protocol, <a href=https://ogp.me/>the Open Graph protocol</a>, and it is fairly easy to use, and so I did use in the file <a href=https://github.com/KevCaz/funkyflex/blob/9189be9e81edd1d223d8aff1251b6551cb5610aa/layouts/partials/head.html#L42-L48>header.html</a> of my theme and I even made it an optional parameter for having specific text/image for posts in my website (see <a href=https://github.com/KevCaz/KevCaz.github.io/blob/772c1c6205e759ecd503ba82341c7c615b426b78/layouts/partials/head_custom.html>head_custom.html</a>)!</p><center><figure><img class=mg-bot src=./assets/shared_on_slack.png width=60%><figcaption><div class="highlight justify"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden></i> URL of my home page shared on Slack.</div></figcaption></figure></center><p>Finally, even though I had (and still have) very limited JavaScript skills, I
figured how to create my secondary basic using the Document Object Model (DOM)
(see my
<a href=https://github.com/KevCaz/funkyflex/blob/master/static/js/sidebar-secondary.js>sidebar-secondary.js</a>
file). What amazed me is that with less than 15 lines of code I was able to
avoid appending an external library such as
<a href=http://gregfranko.com/jquery.tocify.js/>Tocify</a>, which is a great one, but
definitively an overkill for my needs.</p><h3 id=more-hugo-features>More Hugo features</h3><p>As I mentioned above, one of my goal was to use as much Hugo features as I
could, which was a very sensible choice of mine! Lucky me, when I worked on this
project, <a href=https://gohugo.io/news/0.60.0-relnotes/>Hugo 60</a> just came out which
was bringing new improvements! One of the major new feature was that Hugo became
<a href=https://gohugo.io/news/0.60.0-relnotes/>Common Mark compliant</a> as it uses
<a href=https://github.com/yuin/goldmark>goldmark</a> (a Markdown parser written in Go)
ever since. I had the opportunity to embrace this new feature and one detail
I&rsquo;ll surely keep in mind is that one must use the following in <code>config.toml</code></p><div class=highlight><div style=color:#575279;background-color:#faf4ed;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><table style=border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0><tr><td style=vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#575279;background-color:#faf4ed;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code><span style="white-space:pre;-webkit-user-select:none;user-select:none;margin-right:.4em;padding:0 .4em;color:#7f7f7f">1

</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></div><p>to render HTML tags with goldmark! The second change I&rsquo;ve made and would like to
report here is that I chose <a href=https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma>Chroma</a> over
<a href=https://highlightjs.org/>highlight.js</a>. Chroma has been supported since Hugo
0.28 and it is fast, has various great features (such as built-in line
numbering) and is user friendly, <a href=https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/>check out the
documentation</a>.</p><h3 id=new-deployment-skills>New deployment skills</h3><p>Well, as many developers (I guess), in 2020, I started to <a href=https://insileco.github.io/2020/11/24/continuous-integration-for-r-projects-from-travis-ci-to-github-actions-step-by-step/>move away from Travis CI</a> and I started to use <a href=https://github.com/features/actions>GitHub Actions</a> more and more frequently. And to deploy my new website with a new theme, I created a <a href=https://github.com/KevCaz/KevCaz.github.io/blob/772c1c6205e759ecd503ba82341c7c615b426b78/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml>workflow</a> which is extremely efficient, and for this I am very grateful to <a href=https://peaceiris.com/>Shohei Ueda</a> for <a href=https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo>peaceiris/actions-hugo</a>
and <a href=https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages>peaceiris/actions-gh-pages</a>!</p><h3 id=ive-learned-even-more>I&rsquo;ve learned even more</h3><p>There are a myriad of things that I&rsquo;ve learned and won&rsquo;t detail here. From
little technical details, such as the <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13941275/how-does-rem-differ-from-em-in-css>difference between <code>rem</code> and
<code>em</code></a>
to technologies I was not even aware of, such as <a href=https://katex.org/>KaTeX</a> for
math typesetting (see <a href=https://eankeen.github.io/blog/posts/render-latex-with-katex-in-hugo-blog/>this cool post by Edwin
Kofler</a>).
I may write notes about these in a near future and I will be very happy to use
my website to do so! After a year now, I am very very happy with this version
and I intend to keep it as is for at another year (at the very least), with tiny
tweaks here and there to make my personal website look even nicer! One goal I
have now is to work towards making it one of the official <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/>Hugo
Themes</a>. This will require some work, but I&rsquo;ll be
happy to try!</p><h2 id=tldr>tl;dr</h2><p>Hugo is great! Work on your CSS/HTML/Javascript skills and mix them with Hugo, you&rsquo;ll feel empowered and will easily build the static website that fulfill your needs!</p></div></div><div class=footer2><hr id=hr-footer align=left><div class=social-media-banner><a href=https://github.com/KevCaz><i class='fab fab fa-github-square'></i></a>
